MICA v0.2:

- various bug fixes, including:
 	* reg: include non-full-width registers
	* ilp: not all registers were included in analysis (stopped after first non-valid register)
	* stride: fixed faulty use of readIndexStride in readMem (and analogous for writeMem)
	* reset interval_ins_count for all characteristics
- added features:
	* taking size of memory read/write into account
	* implementation of memreusedist characteristics, useful for characterizing cache behavior
- adjusted:
	* memory footprint measured for 64-byte blocks instead of 32-byte blocks (because most modern processors have 64-byte cache blocks)
	* configuring MICA is done using a mica.conf configuration file instead of command line parameters
- speed:
	* used InsertIfCall/InsertThenCall to make more analysis routines inlineable
	* buffering for ilp implementation, which yields roughly 10% speedup
