MICA v0.22

- bug fixes in itypes:
	* fixed issue with instructions in MISC category being counted double (both in 'control flow' and 'other' buckets)
	  (thanks to Ahmed S. Al-Zawawi for bringing my attention to this issue)
	* added NOP instructions category
- adjusted README file to make meaning of different buckets in memreusedist more clear 
  (thanks to Kshitij Sudan for reporting this)

MICA v0.21

- removed -static from makefile, to avoid issues when linking MICA
  (thanks to J. K. Rai and Ahmed S. Al-Zawawi for reporting this)

MICA v0.2:

- various bug fixes, including:
 	* reg: include non-full-width registers
	* ilp: not all registers were included in analysis (stopped after first non-valid register)
	* stride: fixed faulty use of readIndex/writeIndex in readMem/writeMem
	* reset interval_ins_count for all characteristics
- added features:
	* taking size of memory read/write into account
	* implementation of memreusedist characteristics, useful for characterizing cache behavior
- adjusted:
	* memory footprint measured for 64-byte blocks instead of 32-byte blocks (because most modern processors have 64-byte cache blocks)
	* configuring MICA is done using a mica.conf configuration file instead of command line parameters
- speed:
	* used InsertIfCall/InsertThenCall to make more analysis routines inlineable
	* buffering for ilp implementation, which yields roughly 10% speedup
